## About the project📜
This project simulates a basic bank account management system, allowing you to create an account and make deposits and withdrawals. The application is developed in Ruby and follows a simple user input pattern via terminal, also with the aim of exploring object-oriented programming concepts.

Features: 
Bank account creation: asks the user for the account number and the name of the holder. Optionally, it allows you to make an initial deposit.
Deposit and Withdrawal: The system allows the user to deposit and withdraw amounts from the account, updating the account balance in real time.
Input Validation: The system includes validation to ensure that the initial deposit, as well as subsequent transactions, do not accept negative or invalid values.
Account data display: At the end of each transaction, the updated balance and account data are displayed on the terminal in a formatted form.
